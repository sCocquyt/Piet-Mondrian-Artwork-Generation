# Piet-Mondrian-Artwork-Generation
I'm interested in the geometric style of the artwork of [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian?scrlybrkr=74e99dd8), so I wrote a program to randomly generate Mondrian-like artwork with the ability for the user to change the colors of the panels.
